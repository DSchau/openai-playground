# open-ai playground

Some experiments and fun stuff while I wait patiently for ChatGPT-4 API access. Until then, I take some of these prompts, try them locally, and then use the UI to get the good stuff.

## Usage

This is probably only useful to me, but if you're curious:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- Generate an OpenAI API key
- Use one of the files like `OPENAI_API_KEY=key-you-generated node index.mjs`
- ...
- Let the robots take our jobs and overthrow humanity
